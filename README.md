# Project Description
Composer is an extensible Compositional Architecture framework, providing a set of functionality such as Inversion of Control container (IoC), Dependency Injection (DI), Plug-in framework, Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP), Configurability and Composability for components.

# What is Composer?

Composer is a framework to enable software to be developed in a **Compositional** manner. A complete software system can be formed by composing various smaller re-usable parts together. It simplifies the software development process, and help developers and architects meet design goals such as Configurability, Extensibility, Reusability and Customizability.

# What problems are addressed by Composer?

The items below are high-level benefits of building software in Compositional architecture, which is provided by Composer.

* **Inversion of Control**: Composer can act as a container for Inversion of Control.
* **Dependency Injection**: Composer can inject dependencies of components either created by composer itself, or created outside and handed over to it.
* **Interception and Filtering**: Composer facilitates means for intercepting calls between components, filtering them, or redirecting them.
* **Dynamic Mocking**: Composer has tools for dynamically creating implementations of interfaces.
* **Aspect Oriented Programming**: Composer facilitates easy creation of Aspects between layers.
* **Extensibility**: Composer provides means for building extensible software components quickly and easily.
* **Plug-in framework**: Composer makes it easy to incorporate plug-in functionality in an application.
* **Configuration**: Composer allows software components declare configuration options, which can be provided from flexible sources without the knowledge of the component itself.
* **Customizability**: Composer makes customizing software for different customer much easier.
* **Reusability**: Composer enables easier re-use of software components across different products, and across customizations of the same product.
* **Substitutability**: Composer makes individual components easily substitutable, without affecting other parts of the system.
* **Testability**: Composer makes it easy to isolate a single component or a group of components for testing.
* **Instance Sharing**: Composer can keep track of instantiated components, and share the instance for different uses to prevent unneeded object creations.
* **Lazy Initialization** Composer makes it easy to defer instantiation of components until when they are actually needed.
* **XML Based composition**: Composer has utilities to parse XML documents that specify the composition and registration of components.
* **Extend Composition Logic**: Composer is extensible itself, allowing you to customize and add your own logic to the composition flow in several ways.
