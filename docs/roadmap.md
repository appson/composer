# Composer Roadmap

These features / changes are considered for future releases of Composer, in no particular order:

* Profiling and aggressive performance improvements
* Child component contexts
* Using compiled expressions to speed-up component instantiation
* Support for JSON-based configuration
* Support for Live Composition - so that when you change the composition, already-instantiated components are changed according to the new settings
* Support for Live Configuration - so that when configuration variables are changed, they will be re-injected into the previously-instantiated components in memory
* Easy support for Remote components or Service proxies
* Refactor XML configuration into components
* Easier / more natural integration with app.config settings
* Composition visualization / reporting / diagnostic tools

There are no concrete plans for implementing any of the above features.

If you want to use any of the features above, or have suggestions / requests for any other features
or changes, please create an issue on the project's Github portal or vote for it, so that we can plan
accordingly.
